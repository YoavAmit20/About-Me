I like to play basketball with my friends. In 2007 I started playing basketball in school. In 2010-2015 I played in a basketball league,
and I played with Deni Avdija, who is now playing in the NBA. We won 2 championships together!

I also like to play drums. From 2008-Today I play drums. In high school I was in the school band and we performed in many events. 
In 2019-2020 my band participated in a project with Yermi Kaplan (the singer), in which we created original songs together
and we recorded them in the end. I had a lot of fun!
