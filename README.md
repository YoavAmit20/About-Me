# About Me Website
This is a website that contains information about me, my education, my employment history, my hobbies, and a contact form. <br />
In order to run the website, you need to double-click on About.html. <br />
The purpose of the JavaScript code in Contact.html page is to check if the input of the user (the name, the phone and the message) is valid. If it is valid, when clicking on "send email" button, the page opens your email program with pre-allocated fields in order to send me an email. If it is not valid, when clicking on "send email" button, the page displays the errors near the invalid fields. For example, if the input in the name field is empty, the page displays near the name field "The name field is empty".
