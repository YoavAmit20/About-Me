<p>
My name is Yoav Amit, I'm 22 years old and I live in Herzliya. I was born in 20/3/2000.
</p>
<p>
I am a student at Efi Arazi School of Computer Science at Reichman University.
</p>
<p>
Since its inception in 1995, the Efi Arazi school graduated 6,000+ developers. Companies that were started up by the faculty members were acquired by Google, Microsoft, Oracle, Intel, Cisco, AOL, eBay, Facebook, SalesForce, McAfee, CA, and Apple.
</p>
<p>
Before Reichman I served in the army in the office of the chief intelligence officer in the intelligence corps as deputy head of the bureau for control and surveillance affairs.
